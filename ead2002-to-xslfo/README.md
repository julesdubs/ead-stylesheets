This proof-of-concept XSLT 1.0 stylesheet can be used to create an XML document encoded according to the XSL Formatting Object (XSL:FO, or just FO) specification. A FO document instance is the format that almost all formatting object processors use to create PDF, RTF or other "for print" file formats.
