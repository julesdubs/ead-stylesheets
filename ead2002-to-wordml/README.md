EAD 2002 to WordML
===================

This proof-of-concept XSLT 1.0 stylesheet, when applied to a valid EAD2002 instance document will attempt to (partially) create an XML instance dcoument encoded according tho the XML schema employed by Microsoft's Word 2003 word processor. Why would you want to do this? Well, why not? It's a step in the direction of being then able to edit your EAD in a standard word processor-- though, of course, you'll still need to get from WordML back to EAD...
