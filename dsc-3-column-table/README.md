EAD 2002 `<dsc>` to three-column table
======================================

* Author: Joyce Chapman
* Release date: Sept. 2009

This stylesheet applies to the `<dsc>` only, and provides a three-column table layout. Container values are output in the first two containers, and all descriptive information for components is output in the third column. Layout of embedded component levels is controlled through classes provided in the accompanying CSS stylesheet. It assumes that your institution uses two columns for container values, but you could easily modify it to be a two-column layout for single containers. The CSS does not include any styling other than setting up the classes that will control the display (such as indentation) for the different component levels' table cells.
