EAD 2002 to print-friendly HTML
===============================

* Author: Michele Combs
* Release date: Jul. 2007

This is a style sheet that creates a stripped down "printer-friendly" HTML file - no links, no fancy colors, no TOC down the side but instead one at the beginning, minor changes to the order of some things, slightly smaller text so as to take up less pages, places any indexes at the end of the finding aid, etc. It forces one page break near the beginning so that every finding aid gets a "cover sheet" with the same information. It's a handy alternative to a PDF, for example. It goes with the eadprint.css and all font properties are set in the css, making it easy to change the appearance if desired. Note that users will want to change the logo callout on line 75 to that of their own institution.
