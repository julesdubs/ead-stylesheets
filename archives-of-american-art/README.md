* Author: Smithsonian Institution Archives of American Art
* Submitted by: Stephanie Ashley
* Release date: Nov. 2009

This EAD 2002 stylesheet applies to the whole finding aid and is based on a Cookbook stylesheet which the Smithsonian Institutionâ€™s Archives of American Art uses with the EAD Cookbook for NoteTab Pro tool developed by Chris Prom. The stylesheet has been modified extensively and now accommodates the four different container types that the Archives of American Art uses and/or combinations of those four containers as necessary.
